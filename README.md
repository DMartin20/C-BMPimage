# System Programming Project

## Project Description

This project implements a C program that generates a randomly created data series and visualizes it in a BMP file with 1-bit color depth. The program can be run in two modes:
1. **Sender mode**: Generates data that represents values measured by a simulated sensor.
2. **Receiver mode**: Visualizes the data generated by the sender in a graph format stored in a BMP file.

Data exchange between the two processes happens through file or socket-based communication.

## Key Features
- **Command-line Arguments**:
  - `--version`: Displays the program version, author, and date.
  - `--help`: Provides information about available usage options.
  - `-send`: Sender mode.
  - `-receive`: Receiver mode.
  - `-file`: File-based communication.
  - `-socket`: Socket-based communication.
- **Data Generation**: The program generates random data using a 3-state random walk algorithm.
- **Graphical Representation**: The data is displayed as a graph in a BMP file with 1-bit color depth.
- **Communication**: The sender and receiver processes use either file or socket-based communication.

## System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu recommended)
- **Compiler**: `gcc` version 11.2.0 or newer

## Compilation and Execution

### Compilation
To compile the project, use the following command:
```bash
gcc main.c myfunc.h -o chart -lm -fopenmp
